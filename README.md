# Ball on turntable - simulation

Simulation using [MuJoCo](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control)

There are three simulations

## 1) Ball at steady state

The ball tangential velocity matches the turntable velocity at the point of contact.  The ball approximately stays exactly on the same spot.

## 2) Ball in orbit around steady state location

(For video, see top of this page.)

## 3) Many balls, sharing the same orbit (approximately)
